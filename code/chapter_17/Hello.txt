Hello How are you ? 
I am fine, 
Thanks. How are 
you? Am fine too. 
Heard that you 
are working on a 
book on the 
philosophy of C 
and C++ ? How 
it's going ? It's 
going well and 
keeps me engaged. 
Okay good to hear 
that. All the 
best for your 
endeavor!!!


                   

        I have been
    pondering about
    starting a blog
              on my
   understanding of
        the popular
        programming
    languages C and
      C++ for quite
    some time. I am
     not a seasoned
      writer. To be
   honest with you,
       I am still a
   little skeptical
      to foray into
      this world of
        blogging! I
      always try to
       understand a
      thing to it's
       very core by
      analyzing it,
  understand how it
   works and why it
   works the way it
   does. And once I
  understand these,
  I will articulate
   or rather try to
   teach them to my
     colleagues and
  peers. I think, I
      have got some
    good experience
    in that regard.
